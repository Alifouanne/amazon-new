# Amazone clone 2.0
The Amazon clone website is a feature-rich e-commerce platform that replicates the functionality and user experience of the popular Amazon website. The website has been developed using advanced technologies and libraries to provide a robust and reliable e-commerce platform for users.

One of the most noteworthy features of the Amazon clone website is its use of a fake store API to provide a wide range of products and product information to users. This feature makes it possible for the website to offer a broad range of products, much like the real Amazon website. Additionally, the website features multiple pages, including sign-in, orders, and checkout pages, providing a comprehensive and seamless user experience.

To ensure high-speed performance and enhance user experience, the Amazon clone website was built using Next.js 13.1, a highly efficient web framework for building modern web applications. This framework provides server-side rendering, which significantly improves page load times and offers smooth transitions between pages.

In addition to this, the website uses Firebase as the backend function and database, which provides a highly scalable and reliable infrastructure for the website. The website also uses the NextAuth library to authenticate users using Google authentication, ensuring a secure login process. The website's icons are visually appealing and highly customizable, thanks to the use of React Icons.

To optimize data fetching and provide a seamless user experience, the website uses the React Query library. This library efficiently caches data and automatically updates it when necessary, reducing server load times and improving performance.

The website also features a beautiful and responsive carousel to showcase products to users, thanks to the use of the React Responsive Carousel library. The website's global state management is highly efficient, thanks to the use of the Zustand library, which ensures that the application state is easily manageable across multiple components.

To provide secure checkout and payment processing, the website uses Stripe, a highly secure and reliable payment gateway. Finally, the website's styling is highly customizable and sleek, thanks to the use of Tailwind CSS, a modern and versatile CSS framework.

In conclusion, the Amazon clone website is a highly efficient, feature-rich, and robust e-commerce platform that provides users with a seamless and reliable online shopping experience. The use of advanced technologies, libraries, and frameworks ensures that the website is scalable and easily customizable to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes.
# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
